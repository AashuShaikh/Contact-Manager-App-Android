This is a simple android project which helps to learn about the MVVM architecture

**_MVVM Architecture:_**
MVVM stands for **Model-View-ViewModel**. 
It is an architectural pattern in software that separates the development of the graphical user interface (GUI) from the 
development of the business logic or back-end logic (the model). 
The viewmodel of MVVM is a value converter, meaning it is responsible for exposing (converting) the data objects from the model 
in such a way they can be easily managed and presented.

This projects uses the Room Database as the Data source for the application.
This apps takes the Name and email inserts it into the database. Then we are fetching the data and displaying it inside the 
recyclerView. 
The CRUD operations can be performed on the data.
